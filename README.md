## Overview
Welcome to the Steam Game Recommendation System! Our project aims to enhance the game shopping experience on the Steam platform by providing improved game recommendations to users. We utilize various machine learning models to achieve this goal, including similarity-based models, diversity and novelty-based models, and a hybrid model combining both approaches.

## Models
### Similarity-Based Models
Model 1: Content-Based Filtering <br />
Model 2: Collaborative Filtering <br />
### Diversity and Novelty-Based Models
Model 3: Collaborative Filtering Novelty <br />
Model 4: Neural Collaborative Filtering <br />
### Hybrid Model
Model 5: Hybrid Model <br />
## How to Run
To run our Python code and generate game recommendations, follow these steps:
### Step 1: Data Cleaning
Start by running the code to clean the data.
### Step 2: 


## Datasets
We have the following datasets available for use:

Dataset 1: games.csv <br />
Dataset 2: recommendations.csv <br />
Dataset 3: users.csv <br />
