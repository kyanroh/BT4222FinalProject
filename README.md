## Overview
Welcome to the Steam Game Recommendation System! Our project aims to enhance the game shopping experience on the Steam platform by providing improved game recommendations to users. We utilize various machine learning models to achieve this goal, including similarity-based models, diversity and novelty-based models, and a hybrid model combining both approaches.

## Models
### Similarity-Based Models
Model 1: Content-Based Filtering <br />
Model 2: Collaborative Filtering <br />
### Diversity and Novelty-Based Models
Model 3: Collaborative Filtering Novelty <br />
Model 4: Neural Collaborative Filtering <br />
### Hybrid Model
Model 5: Hybrid Model <br />
## How to Run
To run our Python code and generate game recommendations, follow these steps:
### Step 1: Extrapolatory Data Analysis
Start by running the code to explore the data visually and statistically to gain insights into its characteristics and relationships. 
### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
In this step, we have 3 different codes to clean up 3 different datasets which are:
Step 2.1 - Data Preprocessing (user_sample???): Get 30,000 users??
Step 2.2 - Data Preprocessing (game):
Step 2.3 - Data Preprocessing (user):
Step 2.4 - Data Preprocessing (recommendation): In this code, feature engineering and feature crosses ????Details of the steps were commented at the top.

The results are saved into the folder 'Cleaned Data':

Dataset 1:
Dataset 2:
Dataset 3:
Dataset 4:
### Step 3: Models
Step 3.1 - Content-Based Filtering
Step 3.2 - Collaborative Filtering
Step 3.3 - Collaborative Filtering Novelty
Step 3.4 - Neural Collaborative Filtering
Step 3.5 - Hybrid Model



## Datasets
We have the following datasets available for use:

Dataset 1: games.csv <br />
Dataset 2: recommendations.csv <br />
Dataset 3: users.csv <br />
